## Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Alex and Iâ€™m a frontend developer currently looking for a full-time position where I can continue to grow as a developer.

I strive to write clean, efficient code that improves the performance of my apps. I'm also a big fan of clean, seamless UI:s and I enjoy creating them myself or working together with a design team to develop or integrate them.

With a background in music production and health care I consider myself to be a creative, detail-oriented, empathic guy that enjoys the technical and creative aspect and challenges of creating software.
